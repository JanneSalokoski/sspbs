# SSPBS - Super Simple Python Blog System

SSPBS is a set of python scripts and a collection of html, css and javascript templates, which allow you to render a super simple blog from markdown files. The idea is that you can run the scripts anywhere and host the static web pages wherever you want. No need to have a python process running on the server, plain old Apache will do.
